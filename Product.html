                Utilization of tea extract in various fields has increased worldwide. The extract is used as dye, detergent, deodorant, sterilization agent and medical agent such as anti-dental caries agent and anti-inflammation agent. Green leaves of tea, oolong and black teas are used as raw materials of tea extract powder. The production system of tea extract powder is almost similar to that of instant tea; extraction with hot water or aqueous ethanol, separation, concentration and spray-drying. Green tea extract powder made by this process contains about 25-30 % of polyphenol and around 20% of catechin.

        <h2>USE AS DYE</h2>
        <p>
            Wood, silk or synthetic yarn type fibres are dyed in tea extract solution (1:20) containing 10% of tea extract powder with met-mordant at 60Â°C for six hours. After washing, the dyed yarn with water, the yarn weight increased by 3-5%. By metal-mordants, the colour of yarn changes to pale green, yellow-green, yellow, brown and copper-yellow. It is found that despite repeated washing or exposure to sunlight for the fading test, the colour of yarn is maintained at least for one year.
